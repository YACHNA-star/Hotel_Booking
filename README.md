### Components of MVC

Generally, we know that MVC has 3 components. Model, View, and Controller. But it also has a major component that is equally important to make this framework work in action. And that is the Router. So we can say that there is a total of 4 components of MVC. Those are – 

* View – Where the user interacts.
* Router – Handles the Request where to process.
* Controller – Process the request and send the response to view.
* Model – Middleware that handles the database operations
  
### Routing
The ASP.NET MVC Routing module is responsible for mapping the incoming browser requests (i.e. the incoming URL or incoming HTTP Requests) to a particular controller action method example:the URL pattern "{controller}/{action}/{id}".
